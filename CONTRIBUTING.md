## CREATE A BRANCH

Once the issue is created, create a new branch related to it.
That means the new branch should :

* Start from the branch of the related version. For a bug, start from the first version affected by this bug. For a feature, start from the version concerned by this feature.
* Have a name containing the #number of the issue.

## IMPLEMENT & COMMUNICATE

Well ... now you have to do what you mentioned in the issue !  
Speak with the maintainers or the developers, get advice and remain active.

## CREATE A MERGE REQUEST

Once you are done, test your implementation.  
Squash your commits into fewer meaningful commits, then create a merge request.  
Target the proper branch for this merge and describe how you tested it.  
Finally, notify a maintainer to validate your merge request.
